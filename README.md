Adblock list for comments in Korean news

Comment is good system to get any feedback in many site, actually. But I believe some sites are not. For example, news sites or news services in portal sites have many problem. Real villans who work for specific company or political parties make lots of comments to change public opinions in those sites. Some comments have bad words, untruth based on fake news or lies from where I don't know. 

I don't want to see that comments on the news site, especially in Korea (of course, South). I'll update the list everyday I find news. thanks.  


## How to use.

2. Insert this address right after check the "import..." of Custom section at the bottom of Filter lists tab: 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seedoff/blockthecomment/master/filter.txt 

and then, you can update filter list right away. it's easy, isn't it? 

feedback always welcome. 
Thank you.
